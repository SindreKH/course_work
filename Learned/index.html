            <h1> "The h1 is the biggest header and mostly used as a title. It goes from h1 to h6, biggest to smallest."</h1>
            <p> The paragraph is used for general text.</p>
            <p>"a href" links to another site. <a href="/learned/index.html"> hyperlinks</a>. It can also be used with "target". <a href="/learned/index.html" target="_blank">The following link will open a new page to open the link.</a></p>
            <p>Alternatives are target=_self, _blank, _parent, or _top</p>
            <p>"img src" is a way of linking pictures whether from a different website or on the computer. It's always important to remember setting the right width and height.</p>
        <!-- And do not forget the alt text on all pictures. -->
         <div>
                <img src="engineer.jpg" class="engineer" alt="Picture of engineer from the videogame Deep Rock Galactic";>
                <p>One can also make a picture a link by putting the image inside a a href. <a href="/learned/index.html">
                <br>
                <img src="engineer.jpg" alt="Picture of dwarf from the video game Deep Rock Galactic";> </a></p>
         </div>
        </div>
        <div class="textcont">
        <br>
        <p title="And the tooltip shows like this.">Title allows you to make a tooltip when hovering over a sentence.</p>
        <p>One can use "hr" to split up text with a line.</p>

        <hr>As the text next text will appear below.</hr>

        <p>"br" on the other hand splits the text without a line</p><br>

        <p>It creates a slight space between the first and last text.</p>

        <p><pre>Lastly, you have "pre" which keeps the format of the text. 
                It keeps spaces and line breaks.</p></pre>
        <p>Other ways to change the text is by using <b>"b"</b> for bold or <i>"i"</i> for italic. 
            <pre>The noted ones are:
        <b>b</b>
        <strong>strong</strong>
        <i>i</i>
        <em>em</em>
        <mark>mark</mark>
        <small>small</small>
        <del>del</del>
        <ins>ins</ins>
        <sub>sub</sub>
        <sup>sup</sup></pre></p>
        <br>
     </div>
     <div class=""quotecont>
    <p>One can use "blockquote" to quote a text from someone else.</p>
    <blockquote cite="/learned/index.html"> And the text will appear as if set aside from the real text</blockquote>
    <p>Then there's "q" which can be used to create quotation marks around the sentence. <q>Like so</q></p>
    "Abbr" on the other hand,short for abbrevation, can be used to point to shortened down names like <abbr title="Deep Rock Galactic">DRG.</abbr><br><br>
    Address can be used to create a simple note for address. 
    <!-- The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element. -->
    <address> 
        <hr>
        Written by person.<br>
        Example.com<br>
        Someland<br>
        Russia
        </address><br><br>
    <p>"cite" can be used to put a text in italic, like the name of a book. <cite>Stormrider</cite></p> 
    <p>Another maybe not quite as useful, is "bdo" which can be used to change the direction of text. <bdo dir="rtl">Like this</bdo></p>
        </div>

    Remember to always use comments on text as it does not affect the code itself. One can even hide a line temporary with it. Or larger lines of text
    <!--Like this-->


    <p><a href="#top">Go to the top</a></p>
    <p id="bottom"></p>
